#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout <<"Hello World\n";
    return 0;
}

/*
    Let's dissect the code line by line

    1) #include <iostream>
    #: This signals a preprocessor directive. 
    It basically indicates that what follows after this '#' is going to be a preprocessor directive. 
    A preprocessor runs before the actual compilation stage. 
    A directive is something that preprocessor runs before the compiler translates the code into machine instructions. 
    A preprocessor modifies your source code tect before compilation, and a 
    directive is a special command that tells the preprocessor what text changes to make. 

    include: This is the preprocessor directive!
    The directive is a special command that tells the preprocessor what text changes to make. 

    <iostream>: This is the standard ijnput and output stream standard library file. 

    std::cout
    std::cin
    std::cerr

    To put into final words:
    #include <iostream> means -> Hey preprocessor, could you please include the iostream here!?

    2) int main()

    Every exexutable cpp code needs this main function!
    But why? A cpp executable needs a starting point and main is the starting point!
    After we compile the program we get an executable program. 
    When we execute this executable file, the program needs to know where to start execuation from. 
    Hence to determine the starting point we need a main function in the cpp code
    It is just the starting point of execution/where execution begins
    `int` here indicates the return type of the function.

   3) std::cout << "Hello World\n";

    - std stands for standard
    - cpp's standard library has things such as cout, cin, string, vector etc.
    - std is the namespace and the things like cout, cin etc are organized inside the namespace std. 
    - `::` is the scope resolution operator
    - `std::cout` basically means - look inside the std namespace and use cout
    - `<<`  is an operator used to send the data to cout
    - To avoid using std everytime, we can skip that with `using namespace std`
    - Then simple cout << "Hello World\n" will work fine.
