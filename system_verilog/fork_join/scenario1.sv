/*************************
You have 5 parallel tasks running. 
Once any 4 tasks complete, the 5th remaining task should be terminated. 
How would you implement this behavior using SystemVerilog?

Approach: Semaphore based approach
In this approach each process will put a key into the semaphore upon completion. 
A 6th parallel process monitors the semaphore/waits till it can collect 4 keys. Once it collects 4 keys, it disables the fork

    semaphore sem = new(0); //Initialize with 0  keys at the start.
    // As each of the parallel processes complete, they will put a key. 
    //Monitor process checks if 4 keys are available. If yes, it will disable the fork
